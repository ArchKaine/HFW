            <div class="scenario-narrative"><h3>Scenario 1: Xenothreat Convoy Interdiction (Pyro System)</h3><h4>Spectre Shadow - "Ghost" (Pilot):</h4><p>Pyro system. Always a hive of scum and villainy, even more so now with Xenothreat digging in. My job: find the rats. The Shadow slipped through the asteroid fields like a phantom, our adaptive countershading shimmering against the debris. Sensors were alive, picking up the faint signatures of the XT convoy. Three transports, lumbering like bloated ticks, and a pair of those aggressive Ares fighters buzzing around them. I laid down a trail of EW drones, little digital gremlins to blind any eyes that might be watching. Net (Lockdown) was already in position, a silent sentinel waiting at the jump point. Hammer (Strike) was nestled in our ambush zone, his railguns probably humming with anticipation. Surge (Pulse) was our insurance policy, hanging back, ready to shut down anything that got too spicy. It was textbook, the kind of coordinated dance we'd practiced a hundred times. Now, just had to give the signal.</p><h4>Spectre Lockdown - "Net" (Pilot):</h4><p>Hanging at the Lagrange point, the void stretched out before me, deceptively empty. Pyro was a mess of jump routes, and predicting exactly where they’d try to bolt was always a gamble. But Ghost’s intel was solid. I felt the familiar thrum of the QED charging, ready to drop the net the moment their quantum drives spun up. Patience was key. Let Hammer do the talking with his railguns, scare them good and proper. Then, the frantic scramble to escape… that’s when I’d make my move. Just gotta be ready, fingers on the trigger, waiting for that tell-tale shimmer of a jump attempt. Gotcha! Quantum drive spooled, and I slammed the QED. Pulled them right back. "Ghost, NetCatcher should be inbound. Quarry's all yours."</p><h4>Spectre Strike - "Hammer" (Pilot):</h4><p>My teeth were practically grinding. All that waiting… but that’s the name of the game in stealth. The lead transport filled my targeting display, a fat, juicy target practically begging for a taste of my railguns. Ghost’s voice in my ear, “Three… two… one… fire.” The twin size fives roared, even though you couldn’t hear a damn thing outside. Watched those slugs tear through their shields like wet paper, right into the engines. Beautiful. The whole convoy went into a panic. Those Ares boys started swarming, but I was already ghosting back into the black, letting Surge handle the fireworks.</p><h4>Spectre Pulse - "Surge" (Pilot):</h4><p>Hammer hit them hard, just like we planned. The XT escorts were all riled up, trying to figure out what the hell just happened. That’s my cue. I pushed the EMP charge, feeling the energy build in my ship. A clean, focused burst – enough to fry their shields and knock out their engines. The void lit up for a split second, then… silence. The Ares fighters were drifting, their lights out. The second transport, the one Lockdown snared, was just a big, helpless target. Another clean sweep. Felt good to turn the lights out on those pirates.</p><h4>Spectre Shadow - "Ghost" (Pilot):</h4><p>Another textbook op. The XT supply chain was in disarray, and we were already light seconds away, melting back into the shadows. Four Spectres, four different roles, one perfectly executed plan. That’s how you redefine covert warfare.</p></div>
            <div class="scenario-narrative"><h3>Scenario 2: Ground Support Under Fire</h3><p>The air tasted of ozone and burnt metal. Our little outpost, barely more than reinforced hab units and a SAM emplacement, was getting hammered. Red bolts from Xenothreat energy weapons sizzled past, impacting the ferrocrete with sickening thuds. My pulse rifle spitting controlled bursts towards the advancing XT figures. They were relentless, their guttural battle cries echoing across the desolate plain.</p><p>“We’re taking heavy fire!” Sergeant Reyes yelled, his voice strained over the squad comms. “SAM’s down! Anyone got eyes on air support?” Hope was dwindling fast. We were outnumbered, outgunned, and pinned.</p><p>Then, a ripple seemed to distort the air above us, a fleeting shimmer against the ochre sky. The crackle of XT comms in my helmet suddenly turned to garbled static. “What the hell’s happening?” Corporal Miller cursed beside me, slapping his helmet.</p><p>A calm voice, UEE air support, cut through the electronic noise, clear as crystal: “<strong>Spectre Shadow</strong> on station. Engaging electronic countermeasures. Hold the line, Marines.”</p><p>Almost immediately, the tide of the attack shifted. The coordinated XT assault faltered. Their energy fire became wild, missing our positions by meters. I saw one of their heavy weapon teams suddenly turn on each other, confused and disoriented.</p><p>Then came the thunder – silent thunder. Invisible streaks of force slammed into the XT lines. A heavy weapon emplacement vanished in a shower of sparks and twisted metal. An armored personnel carrier further down the LZ erupted in flames.</p><p>“<strong>Spectre Strike</strong> is in the AO,” the calm voice confirmed. “Eliminating priority targets.”</p><p>The XT advance ground to a halt, their remaining forces scrambling for cover, their communication a mess, their heavy support neutralized. But they weren't giving up. I saw a reinforced squad, likely their last push, emerge from behind a ridge. They were moving fast, energy shields flickering.</p><p>That’s when the air crackled with raw power. A wave of invisible force washed over the LZ. The XT figures with shields stumbled, their glowing barriers winked out, and they froze in their tracks, weapons drooping.</p><p>“<strong>Spectre Pulse</strong> has neutralized their heavy elements,” the air support voice reported. “LZ is secure. Stand down, Marines.”</p><p>The silence that followed was almost deafening, broken only by the whine of cooling armor and our ragged breaths. We’d been on the brink, but the “friendly ghosts,” the Spectres, had turned the impossible into reality. I never saw them, not truly, just those fleeting shimmers in the sky, but we owed them everything. The LZ was ours.</p></div>
