            <h2>HFW Talent Acquisition Doctrine<a class="back-to-top" href="#spectre-top">[Back to Top]</a></h2>
            <p>Operating under a mandate that prioritizes results and innovation above convention, Hephaestus Forge Works employs a unique approach to talent acquisition. Standard UEE military and corporate recruitment pools are supplemented by discreet observation of individuals demonstrating exceptional aptitude or possessing unique, hard-won experience relevant to HFW's clandestine mission – regardless of their origin or past affiliations.</p>
            <p>The profound impact of HFW technology on individuals like Marcus Cole (whose encounter ignited an intense drive to master advanced engineering) and Jax Rylan (whose experience surviving a Spectre attack forged an unparalleled expertise in threat detection) has not gone unnoticed. While security protocols remain stringent, HFW recognizes that firsthand encounters with bleeding-edge technology or deep understanding of specific operational challenges can forge perspectives and skills unobtainable through traditional means. Such individuals, possessing intimate knowledge of operational vulnerabilities or driven by a unique understanding of the technology's impact, represent a potential, albeit unconventional, resource pool.</p>
            <p>From its inception, this doctrine led to the formation of the Ghost Teams, elite field operatives and intelligence gatherers whose unconventional skills were crucial for HFW's data acquisition and early field testing. It was through this very doctrine that operatives like Jax "Whisper" Rylan, a former Ninetails outpost technician, was brought into The Forge's expanding ranks following his critical involvement in Dr. Thorne's rescue, his unique insights now directly contributing to the refinement of The Forge's cutting-edge designs.</p>
            <p>HFW believes that true technological superiority requires embracing talent from every shadow, potentially turning former adversaries, reshaped by HFW's own creations, into future assets. The case of Marcus “Wraith” Cole, a former Ninetails member currently at Klescher Rehabilitation Facility, illustrates this. His intense focus on understanding the advanced technology he witnessed, and his rapid progress in engineering studies, has allegedly drawn cautious interest from talent scouts operating outside typical UEE channels, highlighting HFW's potential reach and unconventional recruitment pathways.</p>
