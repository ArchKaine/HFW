            Key specifications for primary HFW platforms. The Spectre and
            Revenant share a lineage, while the Eidolon, Phantom, and Daemon
            represent distinct applications of HFW's advanced engineering.

          <h3>Key Design Features &amp; Systems (Common HFW Principles)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Stealth Integration:</strong> Managed by HFW, combines passive
              signature reduction (e.g., Next-Gen Void Armor derivatives, hull
              shaping) with active measures (e.g., Adaptive Countershading,
              Advanced EW Suite, Acoustic Dampening). Relies on careful power
              management and operational doctrine.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Power Systems:</strong> Typically feature stealth-grade main and
              auxiliary power plants ensuring ample power and crucial
              redundancy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shield Philosophy:</strong> Prioritizes stealth over active
              shielding during infiltration for most platforms. Stealth-grade
              shield generators offer protection when activated.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>'Ghost Mode' Cockpit &amp; Total Immersion Interior:</strong> Advanced
              Anvil-Esperia display technology projecting 360-degree external
              views, often extending beyond the bridge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced Materials &amp; Construction:</strong> Use of exotic materials,
              often involving HFW's internal breakthroughs and insights from
              unconventional research (including alien technology influences like
              MISC/Mirai's Xi'an tech research ).
            </li>
          </ul>
