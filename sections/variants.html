              <h4>Pilot Training Program (Phoenix Protocol)</h4>
              <p>Operating the Spectre Revenant—a complex synthesis of Spectre Shadow tier stealth on a massive, heavily armed platform—requires a unique blend of tactical intuition, instinctual reaction, and unparalleled resilience. To cultivate the elite individuals capable of mastering the Revenant's dual doctrine, HFW initiated the "Phoenix Protocol" training program. This is not merely simulation; it's a radical fusion of neural interface technology and a state-of-the-art, highly classified regeneration facility housed deep within the secured levels of The Forge base, creating an environment indistinguishable from reality for the participant.</p>
              <p><strong>The Process:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Perfect-Reality Simulation:</strong> Pilots interface directly with simulations perfectly replicating real-time combat scenarios tailored to the Revenant's intended operational environment. For the pilot, sensory input and physiological responses are impossible to distinguish from reality.</li><li><strong>Inescapable Scenarios:</strong> Once initiated, the simulation cannot be exited freely by the pilot; it runs to its conclusion, whether that is mission success, failure, or the pilot's "death" within the simulated environment.</li><li><strong>Consequence-Reduced Learning via Regeneration:</strong> A tactical error resulting in simulated "death" triggers the specialized HFW regeneration facility via the neural interface. The pilot's body is then physically regenerated, often within minutes.</li><li><strong>"Super-Regen" and Learning Retention:</strong> The HFW facility's technology is specifically engineered to minimize or eliminate negative long-term degradation, allowing pilots to undergo repeated simulation "deaths" without typical physical toll.</li><li><strong>Immediate Debrief and Re-Engagement:</strong> Upon regeneration, the pilot undergoes an immediate, intensive debriefing, rapidly internalizing critical lessons from failure.</li></ul>
              <p><strong>HFW's Rationale:</strong> This program, while ethically complex, is deemed necessary due to the Revenant's immense cost and strategic importance. It provides unparalleled speed and depth of learning.</p>
              <p><strong>Pilot Implications:</strong> Offers a path to unparalleled mastery. However, the psychological experience of repeatedly facing what feels like one's own death remains intense.</p>
              <ul><li>The Legend of the 'First Flight': Whispers persist of a pilot who never "died" in the Phoenix Protocol simulation.</li></ul>

          <div class="ship-family-content-wrapper" id="content-family-eidolon" style="display: none;">
            <h4>The Anvil Eidolon Series: Agile Shadows for Close Support</h4>
            <p>Following the successful deployment and operational validation of the Spectre series, Hephaestus Forge Works recognized a critical gap in its "shadow fleet." While Spectres excelled at deep infiltration, precision strikes, and strategic battlefield control, they lacked the agility and close-in combat capability required for dedicated escort, rapid interception, and localized point defense against smaller, more numerous threats. The escalating unconventional threats from Xenothreat and the persistent Vanduul incursions demanded not just powerful covert platforms, but a reactive, elusive escort capable of operating within a Spectre's signature profile or providing rapid response around HFW's clandestine base, The Forge.</p>
            <p>Under the continued visionary leadership of Dr. Aris Thorne, HFW initiated a new, highly classified project: the Eidolon series. Leveraging the groundbreaking advancements pioneered during the Spectre's development—including next-generation signature reduction materials, adaptive countershading, and advanced electronic systems—HFW engineers were tasked with scaling down these complex technologies into a compact, single-pilot fighter frame. The goal was to create a vessel that could operate unseen, yet possess the firepower and specialized capabilities to seamlessly integrate with and augment Spectre and Spectre Revenant deployments. The Eidolon would be the invisible hand supporting the invisible hammer, ensuring HFW's dominance in the shadows of future conflicts.</p>

          <div class="ship-family-content-wrapper" id="content-family-phantom" style="display: none;">
            <h4>The Anvil Valkyrie Phantom: Stealthy Insertion</h4>
            <p>Recognizing that even the most potent strike or disabling force requires boots on the ground or assets on the surface to fully secure an objective , Hephaestus Forge Works developed the Anvil Valkyrie Phantom, a specialized variant of Anvil Aerospace's robust Valkyrie dropship.</p>
            <h5>A. Rationale and Design Philosophy</h5>
            <p>The standard Valkyrie lacked the signature management for true covert operations. HFW adopted the proven Valkyrie frame, stripped non-essential/signature-heavy elements, and performed all subsequent R&amp;D, modification, and production internally at The Forge. This self-sufficient approach integrated new, advanced, and often alien-derived technologies to achieve stealth without compromising core functions: 20 operators, vehicle bay, and structural toughness. The result is a Military / Special Operations Transport providing an unparalleled capability for delivering forces and vehicles into contested territory with minimal detection. Unlike pure stealth platforms, the Phantom retains significant toughness and onboard firepower.</p>

            <h4>The Anvil Pathfinder MKII Series: Charting the Unseen Frontier</h4>
            <p>While the Spectre series provides unparalleled covert strike and EW capabilities, and the Eidolon excels in stealthy escort and interception, Hephaestus Forge Works identified a distinct need for a dedicated long-range reconnaissance, exploration, and clandestine pathfinding platform. Standard UEE exploration vessels, while capable, often lacked the advanced signature management and survivability required for operations in contested or unknown hostile territories where HFW frequently operates. Thus, the Pathfinder MKII project was initiated under Dr. Aris Thorne's guidance, aiming to create a vessel that could operate autonomously for extended periods deep behind enemy lines or in uncharted space, silently gathering intelligence, mapping new routes, and identifying hidden threats or opportunities without detection.</p>
            <p>The Pathfinder MKII leverages HFW's mastery of stealth, advanced sensor technology, and sustainable systems, integrating the proprietary "Umbral Drive" for ultra-quiet maneuvering and landings. It is designed not as a combat vessel, but as the UEE's unseen eyes and ears in the darkest corners of the galaxy, capable of self-sufficiency and silent observation far beyond the capabilities of conventional scouts.</p>

              <h3>Daemon: HFW’s Extreme Racing Prototype</h3>
              <p>HFW’s Extreme Racing Prototype, now in limited production as a “super-scout” racer—sold under strict contract to military forces and, in civilian trim, to approved private pilots.</p>
              <h4>1. Origins &amp; Rationale</h4><p><strong>Project Genesis (2942):</strong> Over regular Murray Cup watch-parties, Dr. Aris Thorne, Jax “Whisper” Rylan, and the Ghost Teams would gather to analyze top-tier racing technology. Inspired by their shared passion, they challenged themselves—collectively—to push HFW’s size-1 stealth and vectored-thrust research into a dedicated speed platform. Their collaborative spirit and healthy competitiveness drove the Daemon’s development from day one.</p><p><strong>Public-Facing Racing Series:</strong> HFW positions Daemon as its “racing face,” marketing it under the stringent Super Scout contract: Military Buyers receive Block 1 with full safety, control, and low-signature systems. Civilian Buyers get the same performance and safety, but no classified avionics (EW suites, counter-signature tech).</p><p><strong>Uncompromised Safety:</strong> No weapon mounts—ever. Mandatory HFW flight-training program for all new pilots. Advanced safety-override systems to prevent pilot loss in catastrophic maneuvers.</p>
              <h4>2. Status &amp; Production</h4><p><strong>Current Production:</strong> Ongoing Block 1 runs—hulls serialized and logged by HFW.</p><p><strong>Super Scout Contract:</strong> Bulk sales to UEE reconnaissance and special-ops units.</p><p><strong>Civilian Fleet:</strong> Limited civilian release (price-point comparable to a small house), tracked via mandatory Pilot Certification.</p>
              <h4>3. Key Design &amp; Safety Features</h4><p><strong>Propulsion &amp; Control:</strong> 4× Size 1 vectored main thrusters (2 tail, 2 mid-wing); 8× Size 1 omni-thrusters for 6-DOF pinpoint control; Differential thrust + control-surface logic governed by dual redundant flight-assist AIs.</p><p><strong>Safety Systems:</strong> Auto-Limiter (prevents sustained G-loads &gt; 50 G without sequential pilot confirmation); Stall-Recovery AI (instantly deploys counter-thrust); Ejection Pod (enclosed, high-G-tolerant, onboard life support, certified to 10 km altitude).</p><p><strong>Signature Management:</strong> Naturally low-EM hull panels (unclassified coating); Passive IR diffusion meshes (no active stealth).</p>
              <h4>4. Pilot &amp; Interior</h4><p><strong>Mandatory Training:</strong> All owners must complete HFW’s Daemon Flight School—no exceptions.</p><p><strong>Cockpit:</strong> Single-deck “race cabin”: reclined seat, micro-galley, shoilet, armor locker, weapons-free design; 2 SCU accessory bay (tools, spares, race-kit); Force-sensor mini-stick + thought-filtered assist (full manual override at any time).</p>
