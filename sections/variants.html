        <h3>The Spectre Project: Forging the Scalpel</h3>
        <p>The Spectre was the first major project undertaken by the newly operational Hephaestus Forge Works. Formally commissioned in 2940 by a directive from Imperator Kelos Costigan, it was designed as the UEE's "scalpel" against asymmetric threats. Its core innovation is a multi-role doctrine, deploying four specialized variants as a single, cohesive force.</p>

        <div class="variant-content" id="variant-spectre-shadow">
            <h4>Spectre Shadow (Stealth/Electronic Warfare)</h4>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> The premier stealth platform and information warfare hub. Designed for deep infiltration, intelligence gathering, data hacking, and providing an electronic warfare umbrella for other HFW assets.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Shadow is HFW's truest "ghost." It is designed for persistent, long-duration operations deep within hostile territory. It fights not with overwhelming firepower, but with data, deception, and darkness, turning an enemy's own sensor network against them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="variant-content" id="variant-spectre-strike">
            <h4>Spectre Strike (Heavy Attack & Ground Support)</h4>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> A dedicated heavy strike platform that uses stealth to achieve the perfect attack vector before delivering a devastating, overwhelming blow.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Strike embodies the principle of decisive violence from an unexpected direction. Its stealth systems, while less persistent than the Shadow's, are sufficient to get it into position. Once it opens fire, its objective is total annihilation of the target.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="variant-content" id="variant-spectre-lockdown">
            <h4>Spectre Lockdown (Quantum Interdiction)</h4>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Strategic battlefield control by trapping enemy vessels and preventing quantum travel.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> By controlling the flow of battle on a strategic level, the Lockdown creates an inescapable cage in the middle of empty space. It uses its stealth to covertly position itself at a key jump point, waiting for the perfect moment to spring its trap.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="variant-content" id="variant-spectre-pulse">
            <h4>Spectre Pulse (Systems Disablement)</h4>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> HFW's non-lethal solution. The Pulse is designed to disable, disrupt, and neutralize enemy vessels without destroying them, making it the ideal tool for capture, boarding actions, and asset denial.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Pulse is a master of electronic and energy warfare, but where the Shadow is subtle, the Pulse is a brute. It overwhelms enemy systems with raw power, leaving them dead in the water.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="variant-content" id="variant-spectre-revenant">
            <h4>Spectre Revenant (Heavy Interceptor/Light Destroyer)</h4>
            <p><strong>Classification:</strong> Light Destroyer / Heavy Interceptor</p>
            <p><strong>Design Philosophy:</strong> The Spectre Revenant project was initiated by HFW as a parallel, even more highly classified effort to create the ultimate sentinel for The Forge. It is not merely a variant, but a significant scaling-up of the Spectre's core technologies to a 121-meter frame, designed to neutralize capital-class threats.</p>
            <h5>General Specifications & Key Features</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Length: 121m | Beam: 84+m | Height: 20m (23m gear down)</li>
                <li><strong>Crew Complement:</strong> 3–5 (average 3), enabled by advanced HFW automation.</li>
                <li><strong>Cargo Capacity:</strong> ~270 SCU, capable of carrying up to three Ursa rovers.</li>
                <li><strong>Dual Combat Doctrine:</strong> Engineered for both long-range precision sniping and overwhelming close-quarters "knife fights."</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>The Phoenix Protocol (Pilot Training Program)</h5>
            <p>Due to its immense power and complexity, pilots for the Revenant are trained using the **"Phoenix Protocol"**—a radical fusion of neural interface technology and a state-of-the-art regeneration facility that allows for consequence-reduced learning from "fatal" combat simulations.</p>

    <div class="ship-family-content-wrapper" id="content-family-eidolon" style="display: none;">
        <h3>The Anvil Eidolon Series: Agile Shadows for Close Support</h3>
        <p>While Spectres provide deep infiltration and strategic strikes, the Eidolons fill the crucial role of agile, unseen wingmen, designed to operate seamlessly alongside them and bolster the defenses of The Forge. Uniquely for a fighter, it features a full interior for long-duration missions.</p>

        <h3>The Valkyrie Phantom: Stealthy Insertion</h3>
        <p>Recognizing the need for covert ground operations, HFW re-engineered the robust Anvil Valkyrie, stripping non-essential components and integrating their own advanced stealth and armament packages internally at The Forge.</p>

            <h4>Valkyrie Phantom (Base)</h4>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Stealth Assault Dropship & Gunship. Delivers 20 operators and an Ursa-class vehicle into contested territory with minimal detection. Retains the Valkyrie's toughness and a significant armament for fire support.</p>
            <p><strong>Armament:</strong> Features 2x Size 2 pilot guns, two Size 5 remote wing turrets, and two Size 4 top/bottom remote turrets, all retractable. Also retains two Size 1 door guns.</p>

             <p>HFW’s Extreme Racing Prototype, now in limited production as a “super-scout” racer. Its purpose is to push HFW's expertise in propulsion and low-signature materials into a dedicated speed platform. The result is arguably the fastest and most agile single-seat craft in the UEE.

            <p><strong>Design Philosophy:</strong> The Erebus is not a frontline destroyer; it is a clandestine command carrier. Its power projection comes from its apex stealth systems and its unmatched hangar capacity. It is faster and more maneuverable than any vessel of its size, designed to avoid a direct fight and deploy its own fleet of specialized assets from the shadows.</p>
            <p><strong>Armament & Hangar:</strong> Its primary weapons are two "Tartarus Reach" Heavy Plasma Lances. It is defended by 4 heavy plasma turrets and a dense point-defense network. It carries a fleet of 24 Eidolons, 4 Valkyrie Phantoms, and 2 Pathfinder MKIIs.</p>
