            The Anvil Spectre project introduces a new echelon of covert
            warfare vessels. The operational doctrine emphasizes the
            coordinated deployment of the Spectre family, allowing them to
            tackle complex threats through combined arms tactics.

        <div class="variant-content" id="variant-spectre-shadow">
            <h3>Spectre Shadow (Stealth/Electronic Warfare)</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> The premier stealth platform and information warfare hub. Designed for deep infiltration, intelligence gathering, data hacking, and providing an electronic warfare umbrella for other HFW assets.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Shadow is HFW's truest "ghost." It is designed for persistent, long-duration operations deep within hostile territory. It fights not with overwhelming firepower, but with data, deception, and darkness, turning an enemy's own sensor network against them.</p>
            <h4>Key Features & Systems:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pinnacle Stealth Suite:</strong> Features the exclusive Adaptive Countershading system, a sophisticated EW package running on a dedicated Size 2 computer blade, and enhanced acoustic dampening.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Warfare:</strong> Equipped with advanced data-interception tools and remote hacking transmitters.</li>
                <li><strong>Thermal Obscurant Launchers:</strong> Modified turret emplacements deploy "hot smoke," creating a massive thermal bloom to decoy heat-seeking ordnance and break sensor locks.</li>
                <li><strong>Armament:</strong> 2x forward-firing Size 5 Railguns for self-defense or opportunistic strikes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="variant-content" id="variant-spectre-strike">
            <h3>Spectre Strike (Heavy Attack & Ground Support)</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> A dedicated heavy strike platform that uses stealth to achieve the perfect attack vector before delivering a devastating, overwhelming blow.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Strike embodies the principle of decisive violence from an unexpected direction. Its stealth systems, while less persistent than the Shadow's, are sufficient to get it into position. Once it opens fire, its objective is total annihilation of the target.</p>
            <h4>Key Features & Systems:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overwhelming Firepower:</strong> A formidable forward-facing battery of 2x Size 5 and 2x Size 4 Railguns, capable of using specialized HFW Penetrator Munitions.</li>
                <li><strong>Railgun Overcharge:</strong> Experimental capacitors allow for a single, terrifyingly powerful shot that generates immense heat and a massive signature bloom—a "finishing move."</li>
                <li><strong>Ground Attack Specialist:</strong> Equipped with more numerous, fast-tracking Incendiary Turrets for saturating ground targets.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="variant-content" id="variant-spectre-lockdown">
            <h3>Spectre Lockdown (Quantum Interdiction)</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> The gatekeeper of the battlefield. The Lockdown's purpose is to manipulate quantum travel, trapping key targets, preventing enemy fleets from escaping, and cutting off reinforcements.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> By controlling the flow of battle on a strategic level, the Lockdown creates an inescapable cage in the middle of empty space. It uses its stealth to covertly position itself at a key jump point, waiting for the perfect moment to spring its trap.</p>
            <h4>Key Features & Systems:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantum Enforcement Device (QED):</strong> Its core is a powerful, long-range Size 3 QED capable of generating a quantum snare large and strong enough to pull multiple ships from quantum travel.</li>
                <li><strong>Stealth Deployment:</strong> Its signature reduction is optimized to mask the massive energy build-up of the QED right up until the moment of activation.</li>
                <li><strong>Armament:</strong> 1x QED (Size 3), supported by 2x forward-firing Size 5 Railguns to engage snared targets.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="variant-content" id="variant-spectre-pulse">
            <h3>Spectre Pulse (Systems Disablement)</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> HFW's non-lethal solution. The Pulse is designed to disable, disrupt, and neutralize enemy vessels without destroying them, making it the ideal tool for capture, boarding actions, and asset denial.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Pulse is a master of electronic and energy warfare, but where the Shadow is subtle, the Pulse is a brute. It overwhelms enemy systems with raw power, leaving them dead in the water.</p>
            <h4>Key Features & Systems:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EMP Warfare:</strong> Built around a powerful, wide-arc Size 3 EMP generator capable of being "focused" for greater range.</li>
                <li><strong>Distortion & Torpedoes:</strong> Features 2x Size 5 Distortion Cannons to strip shields, supported by four integrated launch tubes carrying a payload of 24x Size 5 EMP Torpedoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Lethal Backup:</strong> For targets that must be destroyed, it retains 2x Size 4 Railguns.</li>

        <h3>The Anvil Eidolon Series: Agile Shadows for Close Support</h3>
        <p>Following the successful deployment and operational validation of the Spectre series, Hephaestus Forge Works recognized a critical gap in its "shadow fleet." While Spectres excelled at deep infiltration and strategic strikes, they lacked the agility required for close-in escort, rapid interception, and localized point defense.</p>

         <h3>The Valkyrie Phantom: Stealthy Insertion</h3>
         <p>Recognizing that even the most potent strike or disabling force requires boots on the ground to secure an objective, HFW developed the Valkyrie Phantom by re-engineering the robust Anvil Valkyrie for covert operations.</p>

             <h3>Daemon: HFW’s Extreme Racing Prototype</h3>
             <p>HFW’s Extreme Racing Prototype, now in limited production as a “super-scout” racer—sold under strict contract to military forces and, in civilian trim, to approved private pilots.</p>
             <h4>Origins & Rationale</h4>
             <p>Born from an internal challenge inspired by Murray Cup analysis, the Daemon project's goal was to push HFW’s expertise in propulsion and low-signature materials into a dedicated speed platform. The result is arguably the fastest and most agile single-seat craft in the UEE.</p>
