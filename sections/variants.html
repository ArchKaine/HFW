            <h3>Spectre Shadow (Stealth/Electronic Warfare)</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> The premier stealth platform and information warfare hub. Designed for deep infiltration, intelligence gathering, data hacking, and providing an electronic warfare umbrella for other HFW assets.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Shadow is HFW's truest "ghost." It is designed for persistent, long-duration operations deep within hostile territory. It fights not with overwhelming firepower, but with data, deception, and darkness, turning an enemy's own sensor network against them.</p>
            <h4>Key Features & Systems:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pinnacle Stealth Suite:</strong> Features the exclusive Adaptive Countershading system, a sophisticated EW package running on a dedicated Size 2 computer blade, and enhanced acoustic dampening.</li>

                <li><strong>Thermal Obscurant Launchers:</strong> Modified turret emplacements deploy "hot smoke," creating a massive thermal bloom to decoy heat-seeking ordnance and break sensor locks.</li>
                <li><strong>Armament:</strong> 2x forward-firing Size 5 Railguns for self-defense or opportunistic strikes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="variant-content" id="variant-spectre-strike">
            <h3>Spectre Strike (Heavy Attack & Ground Support)</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> A dedicated heavy strike platform that uses stealth to achieve the perfect attack vector before delivering a devastating, overwhelming blow.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Strike embodies the principle of decisive violence from an unexpected direction. Its stealth systems, while less persistent than the Shadow's, are sufficient to get it into position. Once it opens fire, its objective is total annihilation of the target.</p>
            <h4>Key Features & Systems:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overwhelming Firepower:</strong> A formidable forward-facing battery of 2x Size 5 and 2x Size 4 Railguns, capable of using specialized HFW Penetrator Munitions.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="variant-content" id="variant-spectre-lockdown">
            <h3>Spectre Lockdown (Quantum Interdiction)</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> The gatekeeper of the battlefield. The Lockdown's purpose is to manipulate quantum travel, trapping key targets, preventing enemy fleets from escaping, and cutting off reinforcements.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> By controlling the flow of battle on a strategic level, the Lockdown creates an inescapable cage in the middle of empty space. It uses its stealth to covertly position itself at a key jump point, waiting for the perfect moment to spring its trap.</p>
            <h4>Key Features & Systems:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantum Enforcement Device (QED):</strong> Its core is a powerful, long-range Size 3 QED capable of generating a quantum snare large and strong enough to pull multiple ships from quantum travel.</li>
                <li><strong>Stealth Deployment:</strong> Its signature reduction is optimized to mask the massive energy build-up of the QED right up until the moment of activation.</li>

            <p><strong>Role:</strong> HFW's non-lethal solution. The Pulse is designed to disable, disrupt, and neutralize enemy vessels without destroying them, making it the ideal tool for capture, boarding actions, and asset denial.</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Pulse is a master of electronic and energy warfare, but where the Shadow is subtle, the Pulse is a brute. It overwhelms enemy systems with raw power, leaving them dead in the water.</p>
            <h4>Key Features & Systems:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EMP Warfare:</strong> Built around a powerful, wide-arc Size 3 EMP generator capable of being "focused" for greater range.</li>
                <li><strong>Distortion & Torpedoes:</strong> Features 2x Size 5 Distortion Cannons to strip shields, supported by four integrated launch tubes carrying a payload of 24x Size 5 EMP Torpedoes.</li>

             <p>HFW’s Extreme Racing Prototype, now in limited production as a “super-scout” racer—sold under strict contract to military forces and, in civilian trim, to approved private pilots.</p>
             <h4>Origins & Rationale</h4>
             <p>Born from an internal challenge inspired by Murray Cup analysis, the Daemon project's goal was to push HFW’s expertise in propulsion and low-signature materials into a dedicated speed platform. The result is arguably the fastest and most agile single-seat craft in the UEE.</p>

        <h3>HFW Atlas-class (Strategic Hauler)</h3>
        <p><strong>Classification:</strong> Frigate-class / Strategic Heavy Freighter</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Strategic Logistics & High-Value Asset Transport</p>
        <p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Hephaestus Forge Works (XL Shipyard Division, The Forge)</p>
        <p><strong>In Service:</strong> Primary HFW logistics platform since 2952</p>

        <h4>I. Design Philosophy & Role</h4>
        <p>The Atlas was developed to solve a critical HFW challenge: the secure and rapid movement of large quantities of sensitive materials, prototype components, and personnel between The Forge and deep-space operational zones. As HFW's first frigate-class logistics platform, it was engineered with a "Strategic Blockade Runner" philosophy. Its primary defenses are its exceptional speed for its size and a suite of signature-reducing technologies that make it a ghost compared to any other freighter in its class. While not a true stealth ship like the Spectre or Erebus, the Atlas is designed to be exceptionally difficult to detect at long range and even harder to track, making it the perfect workhorse for an organization that operates in the shadows.</p>

        <h4>II. Performance Profile</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> For its immense size, the Atlas is remarkably fast. Its oversized HFW power plants and high-efficiency thrusters give it a top sub-light speed that can outrun most conventional interceptors. Its quantum drive is a top-tier military-grade unit, emphasizing rapid spooling and high cruise velocity.</li>
            <li><strong>Maneuverability:</strong> Ponderous, as expected for a 220m freighter. However, its powerful HFW maneuvering thrusters and advanced inertial dampeners make it surprisingly responsive for its class during docking and low-speed maneuvers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>III. General Specifications & Key Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Length:</strong> 220 meters</li>
            <li><strong>Beam (Width):</strong> 50 meters</li>
            <li><strong>Height (Thickness):</strong> 70 meters</li>
            <li><strong>Crew Complement:</strong> 4-6 (Pilot, Co-Pilot/Navigator, Engineer, 2x Turret Gunners, optional: Logistics Officer)</li>
            <li><strong>Cargo Capacity:</strong> 7,500 SCU</li>
            <li><strong>HFW "Aegis Protocol" System Hardening:</strong> Exceptionally resilient to EMP, distortion, and other energy-based warfare.</li>
            <li><strong>Signature-Reduced Hull Design:</strong> The Atlas's unique, vaguely cetacean shape is not purely aesthetic. Its smooth, blended contours are specifically designed to reduce its cross-section and deflect active sensor pings.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Cargo Handling:</strong> Features a massive forward "Gulp" ramp in the bow section for vehicle and oversized cargo loading, supplemented by an automated magnetic grid cargo management system.</li>
