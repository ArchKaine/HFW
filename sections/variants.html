  <h3>Spectre Revenant (Heavy Interceptor/Light Destroyer)</h3>
  <p><strong>Classification:</strong> Light Destroyer / Heavy Interceptor</p>
  <p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Hephaestus Forge Works (XL Shipyard Division, The Forge)</p>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> Highly classified, limited production, dedicated HFW asset.</p>

  <h4>I. Design Philosophy & Role</h4>
  <p>The Spectre Revenant project was initiated by HFW as a parallel, even more highly classified effort than the standard Spectre program. It was conceived with a singular purpose: to serve as the ultimate sentinel for HFW's most valuable asset, <strong>The Forge</strong>. While the other Spectre variants are "scalpels" designed for surgical strikes, the Revenant is HFW's <strong>shield and hammer</strong>—a purpose-built defensive dreadnought intended to neutralize any significant threat to their hidden sanctuary, up to and including capital ships.</p>
  <p>It leverages the core technological advancements of the Spectre project but scales them to a massive 121-meter frame, prioritizing direct combat effectiveness and survivability. Its very existence represents HFW's triumph in achieving <strong>Shadow-class stealth</strong> on a platform of unprecedented size, allowing it to dictate the terms of any defensive engagement.</p>
  
  <h4>II. General Specifications & Key Features</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Length: 121m | Beam: 84+m | Height: 20m (23m gear down)</li>
    <li><strong>Crew Complement:</strong> 3–5 (average 3), enabled by advanced HFW automation.</li>
    <li><strong>Cargo Capacity:</strong> ~270 SCU, capable of carrying up to three Ursa rovers.</li>
    <li><strong>Dual Combat Doctrine:</strong> Engineered for both long-range precision sniping with its heavy forward armament and overwhelming close-quarters "knife fights," using its stealth to close distance.</li>
    <li><strong>Capital Threat Neutralization:</strong> Explicitly designed and armed to effectively engage and neutralize frigate- and destroyer-class vessels.</li>
    <li><strong>HFW "Aegis Protocol" System Hardening:</strong> Exceptionally resilient to EMP, distortion, and other energy-based warfare.</li>

      <li><strong>Point Defense Network:</strong> 8x Dual Point Defense Cannons.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>IV. The Phoenix Protocol (Pilot Training Program)</h4>
  <p>Operating the Spectre Revenant requires a unique blend of tactical intuition and unparalleled resilience. To cultivate the elite individuals capable of mastering the Revenant, HFW initiated the **"Phoenix Protocol"**. This is a radical fusion of direct neural interface technology and a state-of-the-art, highly classified regeneration facility housed deep within The Forge.</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>The Process:</strong> Pilots interface directly with simulations that are indistinguishable from reality. A tactical error resulting in simulated "death" triggers the regeneration facility via the neural interface, allowing the pilot to rapidly internalize critical lessons from their "fatal" mistakes.</li>
      <li><strong>HFW's Rationale:</strong> This ethically complex program is deemed necessary due to the Revenant's immense cost and strategic importance, providing a path to unparalleled mastery in a compressed timeframe.</li>
      <li><strong>The Legend:</strong> Whispers persist within HFW of two pilots—Cmdr. Ghost and Jax Rylan—who, in separate trials, completed the entire qualification gauntlet without a single simulated death.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>V. Acquisition & Deployment Doctrine</h4>
  <p>The Spectre Revenant cannot be purchased. It is an undertaking tied directly to a player's actions and reputation. It can only be acquired through two paths: **Lawful Acquisition** (recovering a lost Revenant for HFW, who then "gifts" it to the player) or **Criminal Acquisition** (stealing one directly from HFW). In either case, the ship becomes account-bound and cannot be traded. If a player betrays HFW's trust or continues to act against them, the loss of their Revenant is permanent, and they receive the **"Mark of HFW,"** preventing them from ever acquiring another.</p>

        <h3>The Anvil Eidolon Series: Agile Shadows for Close Support</h3>
        <p>Following the successful deployment and operational validation of the Spectre series, Hephaestus Forge Works recognized a critical gap in its "shadow fleet." While Spectres excelled at deep infiltration and strategic strikes, they lacked the agility required for close-in escort, rapid interception, and localized point defense.</p>

    <h4>The Anvil Valkyrie Phantom: Stealthy Insertion</h4>
    <p>Recognizing that even the most potent strike or disabling force requires boots on the ground to secure an objective, Hephaestus Forge Works developed the Anvil Valkyrie Phantom, a specialized variant of Anvil's robust Valkyrie dropship. HFW's approach was to adopt the proven airframe, strip it of all non-essential or signature-heavy components, and then perform all subsequent R&D, modification, and production internally at The Forge to create a dropship capable of operating alongside the Spectre series.</p>

        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Limited production runs sold under strict contract to UEE military forces and approved private pilots.</p>

        <h4>I. Design Philosophy & Role</h4>
        <p>The Daemon is HFW's "public" face of performance engineering. Born from an internal challenge inspired by Murray Cup analysis, the project's goal was to push HFW's expertise in propulsion and low-signature materials into a dedicated speed platform. The result is arguably the fastest and most agile single-seat craft in the UEE. While marketed as a high-end, exclusive racer, its military applications as a "super-scout" for rapid reconnaissance are its primary, if unstated, purpose.</p>
        
        <h4>II. General Specifications & Key Features</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Length: 25 meters | Beam (Width): 11.9 meters | Height: 3.69 meters</li>

        <h4>IV. Armament</h4>
        <p><strong>None.</strong> The Daemon frame is designed without any weapon hardpoints to adhere to both racing regulations and its primary role as a scout, not a combatant.</p>
        
        <h4>V. Lore & Operational Doctrine Notes</h4>
        <p>The Daemon project was initially an internal passion project led by Dr. Thorne and the Ghost Teams to see if HFW's technology could dominate the racing world. The resulting prototype was so effective that it was immediately adapted for a military "super-scout" role. The limited production run is offered to civilian racers under strict, invitation-only contracts, a move that serves two purposes: it allows HFW to publicly test its high-performance propulsion systems in the competitive racing environment, and the exclusivity of the ship adds to the HFW mystique.</p>

      <p><strong>Classification:</strong> Frigate-class / Strategic Heavy Freighter</p>
      <p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Hephaestus Forge Works (XL Shipyard Division, The Forge)</p>
      <p><strong>In Service:</strong> Primary HFW logistics platform since 2952</p>

      <h4>I. Design Philosophy & Role</h4>
      <p>The HFW Atlas was born from a critical logistical necessity recognized by Dr. Thorne in the late 2940s: as HFW's operations expanded, the need to move vast quantities of sensitive materials, prototype components, and specialized personnel between The Forge and deep-space operational zones became a significant vulnerability. Standard commercial haulers were too slow, too fragile, and left a data trail a blind man could follow.</p>
      <p>The Atlas was engineered to solve this problem with a "Strategic Blockade Runner" philosophy. Its purpose is not just to haul cargo, but to ensure that high-value assets arrive at their destination securely and with minimal traceability. As HFW's first frigate-class logistics platform, its primary defenses are its exceptional speed for its size and a suite of signature-reducing technologies that make it a ghost compared to any other freighter in its class. While not a true "stealth ship" like the Spectre or Erebus, the Atlas is designed to be exceptionally difficult to detect at long range and even harder to track, making it the perfect workhorse for an organization that thrives in the shadows.</p>
      
      <h4>II. Performance Profile</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> For its immense size, the Atlas is remarkably fast. Its oversized HFW power plants and high-efficiency thrusters give it a top sub-light speed that can outrun most conventional interceptors and pirate craft that would typically prey on ships of this size. Its quantum drive is a top-tier military-grade unit, emphasizing rapid spooling and high cruise velocity to minimize time in transit.</li>
        <li><strong>Maneuverability:</strong> Ponderous, as expected for a 220-meter freighter often laden with thousands of tons of cargo. However, its powerful HFW maneuvering thrusters and advanced inertial dampeners make it surprisingly responsive for its class during docking, atmospheric entry, and low-speed maneuvers. It is not designed for combat agility.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>III. General Specifications</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Length:</strong> 220 meters</li>
            <li><strong>Beam (Width):</strong> 50 meters</li>
            <li><strong>Height (Thickness):</strong> 70 meters</li>
            <li><strong>Crew Complement:</strong> 4-6 (Pilot, Co-Pilot/Navigator, Engineer, 2x Turret Gunners, optional: Logistics Officer)</li>
            <li><strong>Cargo Capacity:</strong> 7,500 SCU</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>IV. Key HFW Design Features & Systems</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Signature-Reduced Hull Design:</strong> The Atlas's unique, vaguely cetacean shape is not purely aesthetic. Its smooth, blended contours and lack of sharp angles are specifically designed to reduce its cross-section and deflect active sensor pings. The hull itself is constructed with layers of signature-dampening composites.</li>
            <li><strong>HFW "Cerberus" Multi-Stage Thermal Baffling:</strong> An advanced cooling architecture that carefully manages heat signatures. Under normal operation, heat is processed through low-emission radiators. For "silent running," heat is instead shunted into temporary, internal heat sinks, allowing the ship to "go cold" for short periods to evade passive thermal detection.</li>
            <li><strong>HFW "Aegis Protocol" System Hardening:</strong> A foundational HFW design principle. The Atlas features multi-layered electromagnetic shielding for all critical components, decentralized and redundant subsystems, and specialized hull materials that actively dissipate disruptive energy fields, making it exceptionally resilient to EMP and distortion attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Cargo Handling:</strong> Includes a forward "Gulp" Ramp integrated into the bulbous bow for large vehicles and an automated magnetic cargo grid for rapid loading and organization of the 7,500 SCU hold.</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate Electronic Warfare Suite:</strong> Equipped with a capable HFW "Wraith" EW package, primarily for jamming targeting locks and spoofing ship identification signals.</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>VI. Armament (Defensive)</h4>
        <p>All weapon systems are fully retractable to maintain a clean signature profile during transit and to protect them from environmental hazards.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Remote Turrets:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>2x Dorsal (Twin Size 5 Laser Repeaters)</li>
                    <li>2x Ventral (Twin Size 5 Laser Repeaters)</li>
                    <li>1x Rear-facing (Twin Size 4 Ballistic Gatling) for pursuit deterrence.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
      <h4>VII. Specialized Facilities & Interior Layout</h4>
        <p>The Atlas's interior is designed for efficiency and long-duration functionality, balancing its massive cargo bay with necessary crew amenities.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flight Deck (Bridge):</strong> A spacious, multi-crew bridge located towards the bow, featuring advanced holographic displays and excellent forward and ventral visibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Logistics & Cargo Control:</strong> A dedicated station aft of the bridge where the Logistics Officer can oversee the automated cargo grid, monitor inventory, and manage loading/unloading operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Main Cargo Hold:</strong> The cavernous, 7,500 SCU central hold spans the majority of the ship's length, large enough to accommodate multiple ground vehicles (up to Nova Tank size), small utility craft, or entire prefabricated habitat modules for outpost deployment.</li>
            <li><strong>Engineering Section:</strong> Located aft, providing direct access to the power plants, coolers, and main thruster assemblies.</li>
            <li><strong>Crew Quarters:</strong> Spartan but comfortable quarters for a crew of up to six, including a small galley, mess hall, and fresher facilities.</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>VIII. Lore & Operational Doctrine Notes</h4>
      <p>Within HFW, the Atlas fleet is known as the "Unseen Backbone." While the Spectres and Pathfinders conduct the high-profile missions, it is the Atlas crews who undertake the equally dangerous task of keeping these forward assets supplied, fueled, and equipped. Atlas pilots are specialists in threat avoidance, using their ship's surprising speed and low signature to outrun or slip past threats rather than engaging them. The Atlas is the only vessel trusted by HFW to transport its most valuable and volatile assets, where the cargo is often more valuable than the ship itself.</p>

        <p><strong>Classification:</strong> Super-Capital (Flagship)</p>
        <p><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Hephaestus Forge Works (Apex Division, The Forge)</p>
        <p><strong>In Service:</strong> First hull, HFW *Erebus*, commissioned c. 2955</p>

        <h4>I. Design Philosophy & Role</h4>
        <p>The HFW Erebus-Prime is not merely a ship; it is a statement of technological supremacy and a doctrine made manifest. Forged in the most secret and advanced depths of The Forge, it represents the absolute zenith of HFW's mastery over signature reduction and sustained covert warfare at a scale previously thought impossible. Its existence is a closely guarded secret, a strategic asset that redefines the nature of power projection.</p>
        <p>Its design philosophy is one of absolute covert supremacy and enduring operational autonomy. Where other capitals project power through overwhelming force, the Erebus-Prime projects it through nearly undetectable presence, information dominance, and the capacity to orchestrate system-spanning operations from a position of complete obscurity. Its extraordinarily wide, multi-faceted blended-wing design is a testament to HFW's genius—a form meticulously crafted to cheat known sensor technologies while housing systems and capabilities that rival mobile starbases. This is the vessel from which HFW can touch any corner of the verse, unseen and unheard, until it chooses to reveal its terrifying might.</p>
        
        <h4>II. Performance Profile</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> For its colossal size, its HFW-designed main thrusters and oversized power plants give it a top sub-light speed that is faster than any other known ship of comparable capital size when not in full stealth mode.</li>
          <li><strong>Maneuverability:</strong> While a super-capital behemoth, the Erebus-Prime incorporates HFW's most advanced inertial dampening fields, granting it responsiveness and maneuverability that is unprecedented for a vessel of its immense mass.</li>
        </ul>
