            <p><strong>Cooling Leverage:</strong> Pilots might be able to leverage environmental conditions—such as submersion in water or differing atmospheric properties—to further enhance cooling efficiency (if/when game mechanics allow).</p>
            <p><strong>Heat Management:</strong> Varying atmospheres and weather conditions could affect thermal signatures, offering additional tactical considerations.</p>
