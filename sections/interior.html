            <h2>Spectre Interior Layout &amp; Systems<a class="back-to-top" href="#spectre-top">[Back to Top]</a></h2>
            <p>The Spectre's three-deck configuration maximizes internal space for crew comfort, system integration, and operational endurance. Vertical transit is primarily achieved via central stairwells, supplemented by additional maintenance access points and a small service elevator for engineering. The design focuses on eliminating unnecessary volume to maximize combat endurance and crew comfort. A reinforced, autoloading ammunition bay is integrated for rapid reloading and robust protection for incendiary munitions; relevant variants (Pulse, and optionally Shadow/Lockdown) also incorporate autoloading systems for torpedoes or missiles. Strategic placement of component and engine access points facilitates easy maintenance.</p>
            <p>A truly unique feature enabled by the advanced Anvil-Esperia display technology is the 'total immersion' interior. Not limited to the bridge, the system can project the real-time external view onto almost any internal surface – walls, floors, and ceilings – effectively making them virtual windows on demand. This provides vastly improved situational awareness for the entire crew, regardless of their location within the ship, and can be toggled off for privacy or standard interior views.</p>

            <p><em>Note: The Eidolon series, despite being fighters, also feature compact full interiors for extended missions . The Valkyrie Phantom retains its dropship interior optimized for troop and vehicle transport alongside HFW modifications . The Spectre Revenant's interior is geared towards its role as a heavy interceptor with a focused crew.</em></p>
