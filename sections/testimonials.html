            <blockquote>“We never saw a thing. One minute, the patrol grid was clear, next minute, half the outpost comms went dead and the main generator blew sky high. No warnings, no visual, nothing. Just... gone. Whatever hit us, it moved like a ghost.”</blockquote><p>— Jax “Whisper” Rylan, HFW Operative (formerly Ninetails)</p>
            <blockquote>“We were pinned down...Comms were jammed solid...Our comms came back online, clear as day. Command said they saw a ‘signature spike’ in the area, then nothing. We called them the friendly ghosts after that.”</blockquote><p>– Corporal Anya Sharma, 12th Rapid Deployment Brigade (re: Spectre Shadow)</p>
            <blockquote>“We thought it was the end. Then, out of nowhere, a series of massive railgun shots ripped through their lines...Like a silent thunder...We never saw what fired those shots, but it cleared a path for us.”</blockquote><p>– Sergeant Major Elias Vance, 7th Expeditionary Unit (re: Spectre Strike)</p>
            <blockquote>“They were laughing at us on comms...Then, their quantum drives sputtered...They were stuck, like a fly in amber. We moved in and took them without a shot fired.”</blockquote><p>– Security Officer Jian Li, Sector Patrol Delta-7 (re: Spectre Lockdown)</p>
            <blockquote>“We were facing a heavily shielded enemy vessel...Then, everything went dark—their lights, engines, even their weapons. Just… off...It was the Pulse. They turned off the lights, and we won the day.”</blockquote><p>– Flight Lieutenant Commander Rylan Voss, 9th Special Operations Wing (re: Spectre Pulse)</p>
