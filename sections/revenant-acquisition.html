            <h2>Spectre Revenant Acquisition<a class="back-to-top" href="#spectre-top">[Back to Top]</a></h2>
            <p>The Spectre Revenant stands apart from the other Anvil Spectre variants not only in its size and role but also in how it can be obtained. As a dedicated, highly classified asset of Hephaestus Forge Works (HFW) and the primary sentinel of the Forge base perimeter, the Revenant is <strong>never available for standard purchase</strong>, either through in-game vendors or on the RSI website store.</p>
            <p>Instead, acquiring a Spectre Revenant is an undertaking tied directly to significant, challenging in-game events that reflect the vessel's unique status and HFW's unconventional nature. There are two primary paths to obtaining a Revenant, differentiated by a player's legal standing and the nature of their interaction with the asset:</p>
            <h3>Lawful Acquisition (Recovery for HFW)</h3> <p><strong>Method:</strong> Players with a strong legal standing in the UEE may discover or be tasked with missions to recover a lost or previously stolen Spectre Revenant from a dangerous location or a hostile third party (e.g., pirates, Xenothreat forces, a rival clandestine group). Successfully locating, disabling (if necessary), and securing the Revenant requires exceptional skill, stealth, and combat prowess against significant opposition.</p> <p><strong>HFW Response:</strong> Upon successful recovery by a demonstrably lawful entity, Hephaestus Forge Works will track the asset and the individuals responsible for its retrieval. Rather than simply reclaiming the vessel, HFW, operating under its unique Talent Acquisition Doctrine, will recognize the unparalleled skill and capability demonstrated by the lawful player(s) in retrieving such a valuable and dangerous asset. As a form of profound acknowledgment and implicit recruitment/vetting, HFW will effectively <strong>"gift" the recovered Revenant</strong> to the player who initiated and successfully completed the retrieval.</p> <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The Spectre Revenant becomes <strong>account-bound</strong> to that player's account. However, this unique gift comes with implicit expectations. Should a lawful player who possesses an HFW-gifted Revenant engage in major criminal activities using the ship, or attempt to compromise, reverse-engineer, or share the Revenant's highly sensitive HFW technology, HFW will perceive this as a betrayal of the trust placed in them. If the Revenant is destroyed while the lawful player is engaged in such triggering hostile or compromising actions against HFW's interests, HFW will ensure the ship is permanently reclaimed/destroyed. This specific act of breaching trust results in the player losing access to the Revenant permanently; it will fall out of their account and can no longer be claimed or recovered.</p>
            <h3>Criminal Acquisition (Theft from HFW)</h3> <p><strong>Method:</strong> Criminal players may attempt the extraordinarily difficult task of directly infiltrating or assaulting HFW assets (such as the Forge itself during a rare, high-stakes event, or intercepting a Revenant on a critical mission) to steal one. Successfully disabling and exfiltrating a Revenant from HFW's direct control is an undertaking requiring immense skill, coordination, and audacity against state-of-the-art defenses and potentially other Revenants.</p> <p><strong>HFW Response:</strong> Hephaestus Forge Works will immediately detect the theft of a Revenant. While they recognize the exceptional (and dangerous) capability required to succeed in such a high-risk endeavor against them, their response is not one of reward. HFW will issue a clear, non-hollow warning to the criminal player who stole the asset, often through unconventional and unsettling means. This warning serves as an acknowledgment of their formidable nature but also a dire threat of significant reprisal should they target HFW assets again or fail to heed the message. HFW has the resources to make good on its threats and is <strong>known to follow through relentlessly on 'promises' they make</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The Spectre Revenant successfully stolen also becomes <strong>account-bound</strong> to that player's account. However, should a criminal player who possesses a stolen Revenant attempt further hostile actions against HFW assets (especially attempting to steal another Revenant), and their current Revenant is destroyed during this confrontation, HFW will ensure the ship is permanently reclaimed/destroyed. This specific act of defiance results in the player losing access to the Revenant permanently; it will fall out of their account and can no longer be claimed or recovered. This is the ultimate price of repeatedly provoking HFW after having already taken one of their prized assets.</p>
            <h3>Account Limitation and Trade Restrictions</h3> <p>Regardless of the method of acquisition (Lawful Recovery or Criminal Theft), a player <strong>can only possess one</strong> Spectre Revenant on their account at any given time. Furthermore, due to the Revenant's highly classified nature and HFW's persistent tracking, this ship cannot be sold or traded on the player market. Attempting to sell a recovered Revenant is simply not possible within HFW's system, and attempting to sell a <em>stolen</em> one is virtually impossible as no legitimate or even moderately cautious black-market buyer would risk the inevitable and relentless reprisal from HFW. Possessing a stolen Revenant puts a target on your back; selling it would put targets on <em>everyone</em> involved.</p>
            <h3>The Mark of HFW</h3> <p>Crucially, if a player loses their Spectre Revenant because they triggered HFW's negative response (either through breaching implicit trust as a lawful owner or through repeated defiance as a criminal), <strong>they will be permanently marked by Hephaestus Forge Works</strong>. This mark signifies that they are no longer considered a potential asset or even a tolerated entity; they are a liability or an antagonist. A player marked by HFW <strong>will never be able to acquire another Spectre Revenant</strong> through any means, whether lawful recovery or attempting theft again. The path to owning this unique vessel is permanently closed to them. Reversing this mark, if possible at all, would require extraordinary and significant reparations to HFW, potentially involving high-risk missions or a fundamental shift in their relationship and reputation with the clandestine organization (the specifics of such reparations would be exceptionally rare and challenging).</p>
